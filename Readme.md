iCal Classic Page Flip
======================
The solution to Apples very slooow Page-Flip animation for monthly and yearly view in iCal 5.


Description
-----------
Annoyed by the very slow page animation in the latest version of iCal that came with Lion? Monthly and Yearly view both have an animation of a turning page. That might be nice on the first look, but it's time consuming and slows down the work flow on the long run.

This software is the solution. It disables the painfully slow animation of the latest iCal version and gives you back fast navigation in iCal. Now again, you can use cmd + arrows to move to the next  / previous month or year in iCal blazingly fast.

Requirements
------------
- SIMBL
- manual installation: see "Description"


Installation
------------

Steps to install iCal Classic Page Flip:

1. Install latest version of SIMBL: http://culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php or http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/18351/simbl
2. Download the iCal Classic Page Flip-bundle
3. Move the bundle into ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins (Note that both SIMBL and Plugins folder may not exist. Simply create those folders if you don't have them already.)
