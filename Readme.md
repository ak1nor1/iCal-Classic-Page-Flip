Description
-----------
Annoyed by the very slow page animation in the latest version of iCal that came with Lion? Monthly and Yearly view both have an animation of a turning page. That might be nice on the first look, but it's time consuming and slows down the work flow on the long run.

This software is the solution. It disables the painfully slow animation of the latest iCal version and gives you back fast navigation in iCal. Now again, you can use cmd + arrows to move to the next  / previous month or year in iCal blazingly fast.

Requirements
------------
- SIMBL
- manual installation: see "Description"
